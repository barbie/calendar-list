Calendar::List
==============

DESCRIPTION

This distribution consists of two modules, Calendar::List and
Calendar::Functions.

Calendar::List is intended to be used to return a simple list, hash or

calendar_list and calendar_selectbox. The former allows a return of a
list of dates and a hash of dates, whereas the later returns a scalar
containing a HTML code snippet for use as a HTML Form field select box.

Calendar::Functions is intended to provide numerous support functions
for other date and/or calendar functions, which are also used by
Calendar::List.
