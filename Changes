Revision history for Perl extension Calendar::List.

0.25    29/04/2012
	- added minimum perl version (5.006).
	- META tests no longer require specific versions.
	- spelling fix. (thanks to Florian Schlichting & Gregor Herrmann).

0.24    15/04/2012
	- removed debugging lines.

0.23    15/04/2012
        - update META.yml to prevent TestData.pm from being indexed.
        - License updated to Artistic License v2.0.
        - removed Artistic file.
        - added META.json and test script.

0.22    18/18/2009
        - added more tests
        - updated documentation.
        - Due to previous rewrite, all versions of DateTime are now supported.

0.21    02/06/2008
        - updated META.yml to correctly include DateTime optional prerequisite.
        - added dubious TestData to META.yml to see how PAUSE and CPANTS 
          respond. This is dubious because TestData.pm is provided in the 
          distribution under the ./t directory, and listed as no_index, which
          CPANTS ignores and says there is a prerequisite missing!

0.20    28/03/2008
        - purely a cosmetic release to render the Makefile.PL time issues, that
          have generated bogus FAIL reports in previous releases, null
          and void.
